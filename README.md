Cyprien's assignment
.........................................................

I used web_api.py and Auth_api.py from <https://gitlab.com/wcf-cwash/devops-homework> as sample python application to build Dockerfiles. 
From those Dockerfiles, I built docker images and pushed them to a Docker registry, I used ansible to build containers from those images. 

I wrote a sample playbook to visualize how I will deploy services and ELB on K8S. I did the same to get container and push them to K8S.

The K8S server crashed and I did not have enough time to rebuild it,
